# 🛒 Urban Grocers - Sprint #4: API Testing Suite

## 📝 About the Project

This project focused on testing the Urban Grocers API, the backend system for a grocery delivery service. Instead of testing buttons and images, I tested the server-side logic by sending requests and analyzing the data responses to ensure the system is secure and reliable.

## 🎯 What I Tested

I worked with several API modules, testing the following functionalities:

* **Kits**: Validating the creation, naming, and management of product kits.
* **Courier Service**: Checking the delivery logic and availability.
* **Product Search**: Ensuring the search engine returns the correct data and status codes.
* **Cart & Orders**: Verifying how the system handles items and prices in the background.

## ⚙️ Testing Workflow

I followed a professional step-by-step process:

* **Requirement Analysis:** Studying the Swagger and Apidoc documentation to understand how each endpoint works.
* **Test Design:** Creating a structured checklist with positive and negative scenarios (Equivalence Partitioning and Boundary Values).
* **Execution:** Sending requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) using Postman.
* **Validation:** Checking HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 404, etc.) and JSON response bodies.
* **Bug Reporting:** Documenting every backend error found in Jira.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* **Postman:** To build and run the API request collections.
* **Jira:** To track and manage backend bugs.
* **JSON:** To analyze data structures.
* **HTTP Protocol:** Understanding Headers, Parameters, and Payloads.

## 🌍 Language Notice
[!NOTE] Documentation Language

All test cases, request descriptions, and bug reports were originally created in Spanish, following the project’s specific requirements. I have kept them in their original language to show the authentic work I delivered. This README provides the summary in English for international visitors.
